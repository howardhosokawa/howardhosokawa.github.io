## Project Overview
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<br/>
</p>

One Focus is a mobile application where teachers can take control of the digital devices of their students restricting access to their phones except for students with ADD/ADHD needing it.  

My team and I were tasked to **select a social responsibility topic, and develop a problem statement** for one facet of the issue that can be impacted positively by a mobile app. Additionally, propose a prospective sponsor for the app, whose **brand we can leverage in the visual design**.

>The start of this adventure begins when four adventurer’s meet in a tavern...wait, this isn’t how the story actually went but in needing to tell the story of this project I thought it’d be a silly and fun hook.  This is what actually happened:

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/researching.jpg" alt="" title="test image1"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Research must be conducted to find a problem that is truley solvable especially in 2 weeks
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<br/>

I assisted in the design of the teacher facing side of a brand new mobile application that the teachers can use to control mobile devices in their classroom.  The solution me and my team reached was to allow teachers to control the student's devices while allowing access to the students who need digital devices for assistive learning.  My team and I reached this conclusion from interviews with our users, researching the current market for similarities, and multiple iterations until we were able to condense the problem.  

## The Research
<hr/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<br/>
</p>

### Interviews

* Teachers always had a **difficult time keeping their students engaged** especially with personal devices on the student
* Classic teacher solution was to confiscate all phones at the start of the class
* ADD/ADHD students usually had a waiver to use **digital devices to assist their learning**
* School districts may not train or let teachers know those students can use digital device leading into **conflicts unless the student or parent is on top of it**
* Digital devices are permiated throughout the school learning experience but **needs to be controlled in a limited manner to allow for optimal engagement**
* Teachers **used their own personal techniques and management systems** (sometimes restricted by school district) to organize how they shared content (_this is important later as it made us realize my team and I didn't need to address this behaviour_)

From the interviews that were conducted, **engagement and focus of students in a classroom** was one of the more heavily impacted parts of teaching.  Further, ADD/ADHD students needed special care but a **teacher did not have the time or training sometimes to notice their needs**.  


### Comparative
* Most services only focused on content and content organizations like Teaching Management Systems (TMS)
* Services that did block, **only blocked for everyone and everything but not on an individual basis**
* Many services **focused on communication with the teachers** instead of taking the control of digital devices in the classroom

### MVP

<div class="col three caption">
	MVP analysis we looked to complete with the limited time on the project that could be completed   
</div>

* Looking to save time the focus moved to having a class roster for individual blocking
* Another feature that would be easier to implement became the **block everyone on the class roster with one click** (this becomes the title of our product)
* Quick block so the utility and ease of use of the product when the teachers need to **take control of the digital classroom** so the students can focus on the teacher instead

<strong>And now, the problem:</strong> giving teachers control of student's focus by minimizing mobile phone distractions.

## IDEATION

<h3>Sketches</h3>

	The homescreen which had all the big four menu and options.  This also will change to be minimized.  The main "lock everyone's device out" option after testing will change due to the low visibility.  Additionally the wording changed from lock to focus
</div>


* At the start of the design process **I had too much broad scope**, the design becomes a lot more fine tuned with each iteration
* As more testing and research was being completed I looked to focusing on one aspect other services may not have had;**Preventing content from being used in class to those who did not need**
* Allowing control of the classroom's digital devices meant **less time spent on trying to keep a track on managing student focus**

* Wording for the final solution was important; **The design went from paywall to locked to finally Focus Mode**
* Visibility became important after many rounds of testing and so the **button slider became larger**

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<h2>In conclusion...</h2>
<br/>
Hindsight is always 20/20 they say, and in the practice and execution of UX design I find this always to be true.  If I had a time machine for every decision I would have the perfect UX product.  But I do not, instead I have the knowledge I gained from this project to adapt and overcome into a new and better me as a designer. 

> We come to the conclusion and insight of our adventure, the dragon slayed, the treasure brought back and we should rejoice! But wait I realize that the story continues and we could have done better. 

<br/>
<h2>TAKEAWAYS & LEARNINGS</h2>
<hr/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<br/>
</p>

* I was able to gain insight into the whole of a design process while observing it from a lane that was not mine.  
* I was able to influence decisions within the group and practice the art of each task without having to be responsible for it.  For the responsibility  of my own deliverables I gained valuable insight into what I was blocking in the long run for my team and what I gained and could have done better.  
* Initially when I thought I knew partially how to do a usability plan, now I can safely say that I would change to be a lot more open ended in my tasks but still keep some rigidity.  I would rethink some of the questions I have written to ask the user so I get a clearer picture.  And the tasks would be a lot more general so I can test the idea, not the functionality of the button.  
* Looking back I would organize and label the slide deck a lot better to show the iterations.  I would show the iteration so that I could explain my story better just like I am explaining it here.  I want to gain a more visual eye so this was a great experience in trying to tell a story well.  At the start I thought having all this insight to my other teammates processes, ideas to brainstorm off of, and help them with their tasks when asked was diminish my involvement with the project.  Instead it increased my involvement and insight with the solution we wanted to solve. 
* Zooming out (eagle eye view) and zooming in (bugs eye view) is a hard balancing act.  I now know better when to be looking at the details closely and when to zoom out to keep the big picture in mind.  As a designer this is a crucial skill I am learning to avoid the pitfall that is being too close or far from your idea so you can deliver the product.  
* Project management of other designers is a skill that is not taught anywhere.  Being forced into the role I have gained better time management for myself as well as the people I worked with.  I also gained more empathy and skill to teach/help/communicate ideas to other team members in a way they learn best.
* Miscommunication can happen very easily both in design of your product as well as your team.  Being clear and consice on ideation is very much needed.

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<h4 style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">My thoughts overall</h4>
There was not enough time to really solve everything we wanted to address within a two week project.  I made executive decisions for the group to meet our deadline.  But I also noted the additional features, processes we would have done, and further research I would recommend.  

Overall, brainstorming and generative design exploration was an intense and iterative experience I enjoyed. Filtering many ideas down to shared ideas and a shared commitment was difficult but rewarding: I learned how to communicate to my teammates in different ways that addressed their styles. From brainstorming, sketching, setting up research, and testing our solution we journeyed through an intensive cycle of expanding and collapsing, eventually producing 6 different versions of our solution. And with more time, the 7th would be even better! We gained great insight into problem solving, details of app design, and having good team alignment.

It was also interesting to note that in here I can write about the role I was give and the role I played.  At the start of this project we did an exercise in the 6 hats by Edward DeBono.  Here my team labeled me as a blue hat, this hat was a more managerial role of the other six hats (I personally thought I was more white hat; the logical thinker and reasoner.)  So with that I was given the managerial role of the rest of my team.  This was interesting to me in the conclusion of this project because it pushed me into a zone that I wasn’t the most comfortable with and it may have shown with our time management of this project slightly.  I tried to look and see what may work for each team member.  It was indeed a juggling act that was new to me where I had to balance out my own work with managing my teams goals.  In the end I learned a valuable experience of how I can use it to time box my own tasks and see where I can help my teammates better.  It also showed me to really understand what parts of the design process were flexible versus what parts needed to be completed before another can be done.  If I was put in that role again (Narrator: He was) [img: morgan freeman meme] I now have a better grasp on what I needed to do to manage a team while being able to do my own work.  

We presented our project and we had great response to our solution - clean, simple, an clear to communicate. It felt great that we hit the target and all of the exploration we did landed us on a clear and concise solution. <strong>Simplifying is hard.</strong>

<!-- <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ideation_3.jpg" alt="" title="test image1"/>

I had the philosophy which I discussed with my team that there was no such thing as a bad idea, only ideas that can get validated.  Here is where we wrote up as many social problems we think we could solve with an application.  We started with the idea of connecting mentors to underprivileged kids.  After realizing that this was either too big or the solution was a bit too broad, we decided to focus within a field.  I suggested STEM as I thought the interest in STEM native talent in the US was lacking.  I navigated our group to brainstorm how we can make this a problem.

#### Brainstorm 2

<img class="col one right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ideation_5.jpg" alt="" title="test image1"/>


After brainstorming we saw that maybe resources for STEM was too spread and wide for students so we can now instead focus on collecting these resources for the students in a central location.  After feedback for our prompt we realized this was still too much to finish in a two week timeline.  It was suggested to maybe narrow it inside of STEM.  We chose Math as it was underrepresented in public school systems.  Further feedback shows that this was too large again.  We interview some teachers and instructors to see if this was even a problem.  I helped one of the team members in charge of creating questions for the user interviews to make it open ended and to create the form so we were able to digitally collect some responses.  I took on the leadership role with the research.  I moved to assist my team here from helping build the questions we needed to ask, taking notes for the interview, and provided additional insight into the complete research insights. From this, me and my team were able to see that it wasn’t the content collection that was the problem but mayhaps the focus in the classroom was the issue.

<div class="col three caption">

The online questionaire we sent out to some teachers we knew.  Teachers as a group to target and collect information is hard as their time was extra valuable compared to some users so we went the route of online forms so they could answer at their leisure.   
</div>

#### Brainstorm 3
<img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/ideation_6.jpg" alt="" title="" style="margin-top: 15px;"/>

I sat in listening and taking notes in the interview and reading the feedback of the online questionnaire that teachers were savvy at finding resources on their own but organising may have been an issue.  They also saw that they wanted to champion and feel good when the student felt good, so easing this process could be a thing we could maybe focus on.  I then received feedback from the researchers for competitive and comparative research analysis.  We saw that there were a few applications and features that existed for a Teaching Management System (TMS).  Here is where I realized we could focus on a feature that may have been missing all together; controlling the information that is getting to the student’s devices during class time.  But the feature wasn’t as prominent at the start of this iteration and to reach that we will have done a bit of testing and rescoping later down the line.  For now I navigated our group to work in the direction that would work to help teachers organize the curriculum and search for resources they can add directly.  


<h4 id="brainstorm-4">Brainstorm 4</h4>

<img class="col one right" src="{{ site.baseurl}}/img/ideation_2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="margin-top: 15px;"/>


As we started to work in this direction, we received feedback that this as a scope was not as social or too big to solve with an application.  I then suggested to move our group to think and brainstorm about what we can do with the current idea.  What I received was that students with disabilities who needed their digital device during class may have needed additional assistance from instructors/teachers.  This was the path I moved our group towards with narrowing the focus to ADD/ADHD for this project.  Further interview revealed that this indeed may have been an issue as digital devices in a classroom can be a distraction for ADD/ADHD based students, but they also may have tools digitally needed to assist them with their studies.  With this information in hand we finally found the “problem” our group was trying to solve.   -->


<!-- With our MVP analysis done as well we were able to see which features were even viable from being able to address the problem and meet the time frame.  I assisted the team member who was responsible for the initial sketches with whiteboard drawing and simple sketches on regular sketch paper.  When we decided we had a simple enough concept I handed off my brainstormed sketches, so he can fine tune it in a deliverable.  I then assisted with another teammate on how the user flow was going to operate while considering my usability plan to test our sketches.  As I handed the rough idea of the first set of tasks for him to complete the user flow, I started to discuss the journey with another teammate.

Once complete with the version one of our prototype, I decided to run ‘a guinea pig test’ - our first usability test.  This test was meant to clear up any hard faults in my usability plan, highlight obvious or glaring issues with our prototype, and additionally see if I needed to change our tasks because it didn’t make sense.  After this trial test, I realized and understood that my version one of the plan had a some faults, and some screens were required that were missing.  With this in mind I directed the sketcher to quickly add some new screens or features that would make the flow of completing tasks smoother.  I also decided to make the usability plan a lot cleaner and more granular (a mistake I will realize later and need to fix) in the tasks.  I aimed for consistency in my plan so when the test was given there was no bias due to the way it was delivered.  Later I realize with our team that time was coming close to our submission date and we needed to focus on one feature only to meet deadlines.

With the struggle to get the problem I needed to solve done in time, I took my team in a direction that can focus on what features is needed.  Here is where I ideated actual solutions with my team and worked to see what would work.  In the end we pivoted to complete in time of the project and focused on polishing one feature which was a complete classroom block from all sources.  Additional features we put in were either in "next steps" or were small enough we were able to add and test.

With the new direction, usability tasks became modified slightly, wording needed to change, and questions asked at the end of the interview had to be modified.  I additionally added the criteria required to produce the test from version one and updated to reflect our correct target and problem.  I visioned the app like most Google products are used; Easy to pick up, minimal training needed, intuitive, and the primary action was able to be done in one click/screen.  We went from multiple calls of action and screens to even less screens with the call to action to be only for the feature we needed.  There was also an onboarding created that had to fully function so that the teachers could understand instantly what the icons I used would do.   -->

<!-- <h4>Hunt for the solution</h4>
<img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/affinity1.jpg" alt="" title="test image1" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px;"/>

I looked to solve the biggest problem of our first step in design.  This was the MVP analysis.  Additionally at this stage in the design we didn’t have a sponsor company we needed to leverage.  This will become important in choosing what might the MVP becomes because if the brand feels it is not something they are part of we would have to choose something that fits them as well.  We finalized our sponsor to be Google as I suggested that they have a big presence in tech and mobile and they also value education and accessibility.  With brand research I did I saw that they had the motto ‘Information in one click’.  I used this motto to address my team we should focus one feature and one feature only at the start because of time table, and anything extra is a bonus that can get applied.  Moving our team towards one laser focus helped us avoid some feature bloat and missing deadlines.  It also helped with testing as we could make our system robust and anything else added on is the icing on the cake.  The biggest pitfall I wanted to avoid and also relayed to my team is that we all have half baked ideas that couldn’t be fully tested.  This feature becomes the primary focus of our final design now; Blocking the student’s phone from being accessed during class time.  But our team couldn’t reach this conclusion until after some iterations were done until then we had a few MVP’s we thought was possible.  This included individual student by student based blocking, full classroom blocking, and content based blocking so students can only see what the teacher wanted to show them.

The first high fidelity on boarding screen and lesson lock screen completed.

With the time running short we finalized the design in version four and decided that version five would have further tests that would have rounded out our design.  I have gotten feedback that our ideation and concept that we solved for was great and impactful.  It was just as I have noted and seen we needed that extra day or two to give it the polish and robustness of testing.  -->

Here are the ideas we wish we could have had and worked on or tasks we wished to complete in our future versions.  Compared to other teams that were working in tandem we did more tests and versions than others which was part of the reason it wasn't fully complete in a way I would have liked.  But, instead we gained the solid bedrock that could become polished into a diamond.
