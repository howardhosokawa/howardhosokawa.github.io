### Project Overview

<br/>

Chef Koochooloo is a web application that combines both cooking activities and STEAM topics together to create an immersive learning experience for K-5.

My team and I were brought onboard to resolve a problematic experience teachers were having when using the application.  I led the team towards a solution that removed friction in the application for teachers by increasing customizability and discoverability for the teachers.   

> This story starts with a new group of adventurers hired to solve the problem of the confusing map to the treasure…

<br/>

I helped create a teacher facing side of the client’s application to make it easier for teachers to teach the content that was provided by the Chef Koochooloo application.  The solution me and my team came up with in the end was to allow teachers the ability to customize the lesson provided by the application.  This insight was reached through observing live demos, interviews with teachers about their behaviours, and viewing the current flow of the Chef Koochooloo application.

## RESEARCH

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<br/>
</p>

### Demo
* My team and I were offered a live demo viewing of how the current application was used in a classroom setting.  
* I noticed there was a lot of downtime between screens and the teacher teaching the activity.  
* I observed that each piece of content seemed a bit long and near the end of the lesson it was rushed because it couldn’t fit in the 55min time block.  
* The kids were easily distracted and sometimes not engaged into the screen or the task at hand.  

From the live demo of a lesson and product we saw engagement and managing the classroom to stay engaged was a big issue.  But this was only part of the problem as we delved further into the research with interviews.

### Interviews

I conducted six interviews with varying teachers of all ages, sexes, teaching grade, and both private and public teaching.  My analysis of all the interview at this point is that teachers did two big things when teaching a class; Break up their lessons and customize it to maintain focus of the classroom and took on average over 2 hours of their own time to plan a new 1 hour lesson.

The big picture? **TIME**.  

Time is used to balance the flow of a lesson and keep students engaged.  A lot of personal time is used by teachers when they have to search for new material or content.

### Journey/Flow
I directed the team to look at the current way Chef Koochooloo was being used and ideated with them on what can we improve in their current setup or what can we add.  With the information gathered we moved to add to their flow so that it would not disrupt the current model.  Designing a new independent but connectable design allows for value added to the business while maintaining the CEO’s passion for the project.

* **Solution to Problem 1 (Customization)**: Ideation moved to modularize the very rigid lesson content Chef Koochooloo had and give teachers the power to customize the lesson in a way that worked for the teachers and their classroom.
* **Solution to Problem 2 (Discoverability)**: By tagging the content in each lesson plan and giving the teachers the ability to search for it give more time back to the teachers as they take less time hunting for the content they needed.  


## IDEATION

</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Our initial sketch ideas we had.  The concept was to customize by rearranging the lesson which was broken up and modulraized.  There was also a better search function to help the teachers find the content they needed.

### SOLUTION

<br/>

## Let’s get visual

The solution had kept in mind the scalability of this application for the future.  Addressed were the two problems discoverability and customizability.  Both of these related to time for the user and maximizing their need.  

<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/T1-V2-Eyeball 1 & 3 off-DONE.png">
<div class="col three caption">
	I finalized our solution to have the eyes much bigger and visual as well as have the slides that become hidden 'greyed' out.  
</div>

<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/T1-V2-Start_France_Lesson-DONE (1).png">
<div class="col three caption">
	The lesson preview screen also contained tags so instead of having to dive through the lesson the visibility of what is in the lesson was right there.  The see more clickable link as added after testing it was noticed that some content was still hard to find.  
</div>


<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/T2B-2-Search France by name.png">
<div class="col three caption">
	At the start the search bar was had more complicated interactions.  After the testing the desing moved towards the 'tag' completion with it showing recomended as well as most recent (last 6) that was searched for.

## TAKEAWAYS
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<br/>
</p>

* Managing a live client versus a fictitional one required a lot of prior skills I had developed in tone of voice and delivery of message while maintaining to be firm with what was going to be done.
* Researching the user base (teachers) required some flexibility in the way we conducted interviews.  There was a mix of video, audio, and in person interviews.
* Focusing on one feature due to unknown time constraints but then figuring out you have time available so working to do two usability tests in tandem in a very agile method
* Thinking about scalability of the product and realizing parts of the product may be needed changed from it's current version; It was about having the thought in the future for what the engineers or the product itself may experience
* With the research & live demo realizing who the actual target user was and observing live how they used the product helped immensly with my direction and design
