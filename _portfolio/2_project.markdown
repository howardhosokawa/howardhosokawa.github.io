This story starts with a new group of adventurers hired to solve the problem of the confusing map to the treasure…

I helped create a teacher facing side of the client’s application to make it easier for teachers to teach the content that was provided by the Chef Koochooloo application.  The solution me and my team came up with in the end was to allow teachers the ability to customize the lesson provided by the application.  This insight was reached through observing live demos, interviews with teachers about their behaviours, and viewing the current flow of the Chef Koochooloo application.  

RESEARCH
[Photo of research]
Demo
	My team and I were offered a live demo viewing of how the current application was used in a classroom setting.  
I noticed there was a lot of downtime between screens and the teacher teaching the activity.  
I observed that each piece of content seemed a bit long and near the end of the lesson it was rushed because it couldn’t fit in the 55min time block.  
The kids were easily distracted and sometimes not engaged into the screen or the task at hand.  

	From the live demo of a lesson and product we saw engagement and managing the classroom to stay engaged was a big issue.  But this was only part of the problem as we delved further into the research with interviews.  

Interviews
	I conducted six interviews with varying teachers of all ages, sexes, teaching grade, and both private and public teaching.  My analysis of all the interview at this point is that teachers did two big things when teaching a class; Break up their lessons and customize it to maintain focus of the classroom and took on average over 2 hours of their own time to plan a new 1 hour lesson.  

The big picture? TIME.  

Time is used to balance the flow of a lesson and keep students engaged.  A lot of personal time is used by teachers when they have to search for new material or content.

Journey/Flow
I directed the team to look at the current way Chef Koochooloo was being used and ideated with them on what can we improve in their current setup or what can we add.  With the information gathered we moved to add to their flow so that it would not disrupt the current model.  Designing a new independent but connectable design allows for value added to the business while maintaining the CEO’s passion for the project.

Solving Problem 1 (Customize a lesson): Ideation moved to modularize the very rigid lesson content Chef Koochooloo had and give teachers the power to customize the lesson in a way that worked for the teachers and their classroom.
Solving Problem 2 (Ease of finding content): By tagging the content in each lesson plan and giving the teachers the ability to search for it give more time back to the teachers as they take less time hunting for the content they needed.
