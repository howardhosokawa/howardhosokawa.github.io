I'm a UX designer and strong advocate for design that satisfies users. To create great design, you have to take some risks! As a customer support agent, I learned empathy for users struggling with software products, and sought to learn to create a better experience overall. As an engineer, I realized that building the solution isn't the same as designing it. Now as a UX designer I'm empowered to not only advocate for the user, but to design the product from the ground up with a sense of empathy and purpose. In my spare time Iâ€™m an outdoor adventuring, snow loving, literal party animal (see below)!
